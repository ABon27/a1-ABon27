This project shows understanding of the processes of Github through the use of 
forking the original repository code to be able to make edits to the index.html
file to then be deployed to Glitch and demonstrate the communication between 
the front end and back end frameworks.

## Technical Achievements
- **Addition of a CSS File**: By modifying the html file to include a reference to a css stylesheet,
the website can have more uniform style and look more appealing to the user.
- **Hyperlinks on Icons**: The use of icons from fontawesome(link https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css)
the website has added appeal to users and the ability to click and hover on the icon
alerts the user that it is a hyperlink meant to improve the user's understanding with 
external information.

### Design Achievements
- **Tooltips**: Shown in `index.html`, the items in the course list each have a tooltip 
to give more information about a particular course rather than just the course number.
