This project shows understanding of the processes of Github through the use of 
forking the original repository code to be able to make edits to the index.html
file to then be deployed to Glitch and demonstrate the communication between 
the front end and back end frameworks.

## Technical Achievements
- **Addition of a CSS File**: By modifying the html file to include a reference to a css stylesheet,
the website can have more uniform style and look more appealing to the user. I spent some time looking up css
formats and tutorials to be able to make the website look more colorful and include more features.
- **Hyperlinks on Icons**: I found and made use of icons from fontawesome(link https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css)
to make the website look more interesting and I have also added a hyperlink and hover color to this icon that goes to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science, which is the wikipedia link for computer science, however the link seems to
not work on glitch but it does work if you open the index.html file in chrome.

### Design Achievements
- **Tooltips**: Shown in `index.html`, the items in the course list each have a tooltip 
to give more information about a particular course rather than just the course number.
The Icon link also provides a tooltip to tell the user what information they will get if
they click it.
